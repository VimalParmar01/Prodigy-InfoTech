# Password Complexity Checker

## Features

- **Real-time Password Strength Analysis**: The application evaluates the strength of the password as the user types.
- **Password Strength Categories**: Displays feedback with categories like Weak, Medium, Strong, and Very Strong based on password complexity.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and clean UI with responsive design.

## How It Works

The password strength is determined based on the following criteria:
- **Length**: The password should be at least 8 characters long.
- **Uppercase Letters**: The password contains at least one uppercase letter.
- **Lowercase Letters**: The password contains at least one lowercase letter.
- **Numbers**: The password contains at least one digit.
- **Special Characters**: The password contains at least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).

The feedback changes dynamically as the user types, indicating the current strength level of the password.

## Usage
1.Run the Program: Execute the script to start the Password Complexity Checking Tool.
2.Read Tips: Review the provided tips for creating a secure password.
3.Enter Password: Input the password you wish to check.
4.View Feedback: The program will display the masked password and provide feedback on its strength.

This code was developed as part of my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, demonstrating a practical approach to assessing password strength and educating users on creating secure passwords.
