Caesar Cipher Program

This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The program supports both encryption and decryption of messages.

Features

Encrypt a Message: Converts plaintext into ciphertext by shifting each character by the user-defined number of positions. Decrypt a Message: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext by reversing the shift. Error Handling: Includes checks for invalid inputs like out-of-range shift values and non-numeric inputs.

How It Works

1.The user chooses to either encrypt or decrypt a message. 2.The user inputs the message and specifies a shift value (between 0 and 25). 3.The program processes the message and displays the encrypted or decrypted output.
